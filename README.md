## Installation & Build

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio with C++ Desktop Development  
- CMake (optional if you want cross-platform builds)  
- Windows (tested), but portable to Linux/macOS with minor changes  

### Steps (Windows / Visual Studio)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Paint.git
   cd Paint
   ```
2. Open `paintApplication.sln` in Visual Studio.  
3. Build the solution (`Ctrl + Shift + B`).  
4. Run the application (`F5`).  

Dependencies (GLFW, Glad, ImGui) are already included in the `Libraries/` and `Imgui/` folders.

## Usage
- Select tools from the **toolbar (ImGui panel)**.  
- **Left Mouse Button** â†’ draw with the selected tool.
